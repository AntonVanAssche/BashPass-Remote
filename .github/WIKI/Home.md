## Welcome to the BashPass-Remote Wiki

BashPass-Remote is a simple command-line tool wrapper for BashPass, which allows you to manage your BashPass passwords stored on a remote server. Just like BashPass, BashPass-Remote is written in Bash, and is therefore compatible with most Linux distributions, BSDs, and Mac OS X. It uses SSH to establish a secure connection to the remote server, and uses BashPass to manage the passwords.

**Note**: BashPass-Remote will only work if BashPass is installed on the remote server.

This wiki is designed to help you get started with BashPass, and to provide you with more information about its features and capabilities.
Here you will find step-by-step guides on how to use BashPass--Remote, answers to frequently asked questions, and tips and tricks to help you make the most of this powerful tool.
